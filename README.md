This is a simple Financial Independence/Retire Early (FI/RE) calculator made for my own usage after encountering several limitations in other calculators.

# Limitations of other common FI/RE calculators
* They don't account for salary/career progression in the saving stage.
* They don't account for living expenses inflation (you may want to live better/spend more money as you get older in the saving stage).
* They don't take into account reduced annual expenses after geoarbitrage in RE stage.
